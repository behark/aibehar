# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Open WebUI architecture, explaining the design principles, key components, and how they work together.

## Design Principles

Open WebUI is built on the following core design principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

2. **Extensibility**: The architecture allows for easy addition of new features and capabilities without modifying the core components.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of the system (UI, API, business logic, data storage) are handled by separate components.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: The system provides basic functionality to all users while enhancing the experience for those with more capabilities.

5. **Offline-First**: The platform is designed to operate entirely offline, with cloud capabilities as optional enhancements.

## System Architecture

Open WebUI follows a layered architecture pattern:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)

- **SvelteKit Application**: Provides the user interface
- **PWA Capabilities**: Enables mobile and offline usage
- **WebSocket Client**: Handles real-time communication

### 2. API Layer (Backend)

- **FastAPI Framework**: Provides RESTful API endpoints
- **WebSocket Server**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Manages user access and permissions

### 3. Business Logic Layer

- **AI Core**: Central intelligence system (implemented in Step 1)
- **RAG Engine**: Handles Retrieval Augmented Generation
- **Model Manager**: Manages AI model lifecycle
- **Plugin System**: Enables extensibility via Pipelines

### 4. Data Access Layer

- **Database Adapters**: Connect to various database systems
- **File System Access**: Manages document storage and retrieval
- **External API Clients**: Connect to third-party services

### 5. Infrastructure Layer

- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Container management
- **Local Model Runners**: Run AI models locally (Ollama, etc.)
- **Vector Databases**: Store embeddings for RAG

## Key Components

### Frontend (SvelteKit)

The frontend is built with SvelteKit, providing a responsive and interactive user interface:

- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable UI components
- **State Management**: Using Svelte stores
- **Routing**: Client-side navigation
- **API Integration**: Communication with backend services

### Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is built with FastAPI, providing high-performance API endpoints:

- **Async Request Handling**: Efficient request processing
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Automatic API documentation
- **Dependency Injection**: For clean and testable code
- **WebSocket Support**: For real-time features

### AI Core

The AI Core is the central intelligence system, providing:

- **Unified AI Interface**: Consistent access to AI capabilities
- **Model Management**: Loading and lifecycle management of models
- **Routing Logic**: Directing queries to appropriate models
- **Response Generation**: Generating and enhancing responses

### RAG System

The Retrieval Augmented Generation system enhances responses with context from:

- **Document Library**: User-uploaded documents
- **Web Search**: Internet search results
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured information

### Data Storage

Multiple storage systems are used for different types of data:

- **SQL Database**: For structured data (users, settings, etc.)
- **Vector Database**: For embeddings and semantic search
- **File Storage**: For documents and media files

## Request Flow

Here's how a typical request flows through the system:

1. User sends a request via the frontend
2. Request is received by the appropriate API endpoint
3. API endpoint validates the request and user authentication
4. Business logic processes the request:
   - AI Core selects appropriate model
   - RAG system retrieves relevant context
   - Response is generated and enhanced
5. Response is returned to the frontend
6. Frontend updates the UI to display the response

## Deployment Architecture

Open WebUI supports multiple deployment options:

## Extensibility

Open WebUI is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **Plugins**: Using the Pipelines framework
2. **Custom Models**: Integration with various model formats
3. **New Backends**: Adding support for new LLM runners
4. **UI Customization**: Through theming and component override

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Authentication**: User identity verification
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Encryption**: For sensitive information
4. **Input Validation**: To prevent injection attacks
5. **Sandboxing**: For user-provided code execution

## Conclusion

The Open WebUI architecture is designed to be flexible, extensible, and performant, allowing for a wide range of AI applications while maintaining security and usability.
