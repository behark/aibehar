# Security Documentation for Open WebUI

This document outlines the security architecture, features, and best practices for Open WebUI deployments.

## Security Architecture Overview

Open WebUI is designed with a security-first approach, implementing multiple layers of protection:

1. **Authentication Layer** - Manages user identity and session management
2. **Authorization Layer** - Controls access to resources and features
3. **API Security Layer** - Protects API endpoints and integrations
4. **Data Protection Layer** - Secures data at rest and in transit
5. **Infrastructure Security** - Secures the deployment environment

## Authentication Security

### User Authentication

Open WebUI implements a robust authentication system with:

- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Secure password handling (bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds)
- Session management with secure tokens
- Protection against brute force attacks

### Configuration

Configure authentication security in your `.env` file:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_in_production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

### Best Practices

- Use a strong, random JWT secret (32+ characters)
- Set appropriate token expiration (shorter for sensitive environments)
- Increase bcrypt rounds for stronger password hashing (12+ recommended)

## Authorization & Access Control

Open WebUI implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for granular permissions:

- User roles with customizable permission sets
- Model access restrictions
- API usage limitations based on roles
- Admin controls for managing permissions

### Implementing RBAC

1. Create user groups with appropriate permissions
2. Assign users to relevant groups
3. Configure model access restrictions through the admin interface
4. Regularly audit user permissions and access logs

## API Security

### Endpoint Protection

API endpoints are protected with:

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- CORS restrictions for browser-based access
- Authentication requirements for sensitive operations

### External API Integration

When integrating with external APIs (like OpenAI):

- Store API keys securely (see SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md)
- Use minimal required permissions for API keys
- Implement request logging for audit trails
- Set up monitoring for unusual API usage patterns

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Secure storage of documents used for RAG
- Proper file permissions for storage directories

### Data in Transit

- TLS/SSL for all connections
- Secure WebSocket connections
- API request/response encryption

### Data Minimization

- Only collect necessary user data
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Provide mechanisms for users to delete their data

## Infrastructure Security

### Docker Deployment

Secure Docker deployment recommendations:

- Use official images and verify checksums
- Run containers as non-root users
- Apply principle of least privilege to container permissions
- Keep images updated with security patches
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive information

### Kubernetes Deployment

For Kubernetes deployments:

- Use Pod Security Policies
- Implement network policies to restrict pod communication
- Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
- Regularly update and patch all components
- Implement pod resource limits

## Security Headers

Configure proper security headers in your deployment:

- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection

For reverse proxies (Nginx example):
```
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;" always;
```

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

Configure proper security-focused logging:

- Authentication events (success/failure)
- Access control violations
- API usage patterns
- System configuration changes

### Alerting

Set up alerts for security events:

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Configuration changes
- Server resource exhaustion

## Security Update Process

To keep your Open WebUI deployment secure:

1. Subscribe to security announcements
2. Regularly update all components
3. Apply security patches promptly
4. Perform regular security audits
5. Follow the responsible disclosure policy for reporting vulnerabilities

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly
2. Submit details through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Provide sufficient information to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure

## Security Compliance

Open WebUI can be configured to help meet various compliance requirements:

- GDPR - User data protection and right to be forgotten
- HIPAA - Protected health information security (with proper configuration)
- SOC 2 - Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

Specific compliance requirements may need additional configuration and assessment.
